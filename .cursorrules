# Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages:
- Keep commit messages concise: 20-30 words maximum
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Be specific and descriptive but brief
- Focus on what changed, not why (unless critical)
- Avoid unnecessary words or phrases

Example good commit messages:
- "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
- "Fix button styling issue in login page"
- "Update API proxy configuration for localhost:5000"
- "Refactor user service to use async/await pattern"
